BST:
First element will be node and subsequent elements lesser than node will be on left and greater than node will be on right

Bigo - 
lookup O(logn) since we're not looking to the other half from node 
lookup O(n) for worst case which similar to LinkedList 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
remove O(logn)
delete O(logn)
insert O(logn)
